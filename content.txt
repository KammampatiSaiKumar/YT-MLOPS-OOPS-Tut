1.Class and Obj (example)
2.Class has data/attribute and func/methods
3.Adv of OOPs:
  >u can create ur own datatype
  >code reusability
  >debugging
  >easy to colab
4.End to end project(chatbook class)
  >function vs method -->function without class example len([1,2,3]) ;; method class object creating and accessing
  >magic or dunder method
  > we can create attribute outside of a class as well
  >self


  >Encapsulation
  >getter and setter 
  >static method

6.Inheritence
  >why ? code reuseability, parent has no access to child class
  >What gets inherited? Constructor, Non private attributes(Encapsulated attributes not inherit), Non private methods(Encapsulated methods not in)
  >constructor overloading and method overloading
  >super keyword (can be used only inside class, can not acess variables/attributes ,used only inside child class)
  >Types of inheritence - 1.Single Inhereitence 2.Multilevel 3. Hierarchical 4.Multiple <Diamond Problem> 5. Hybrid
